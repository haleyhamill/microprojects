        Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is
        an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World
        Wide Web. Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12
        March 1989, then implemented the first successful communication between
        a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet
        in mid-November.

        Web's potential. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of
        the National Academy of Sciences.
