        After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at a
        telecommunications company in Poole. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in
        Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for
        printers.

        Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to
        December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the
        concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information
        among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named
        ENQUIRE.
